The Multiple User Verification DApp is a decentralized application designed to enable secure, authenticated, and seamless interaction between multiple users and a deployed smart contract on the XDC Apothem Testnet. Built as a group project, the system focuses on eliminating centralized intermediaries while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of transactions.

At its core, the DApp leverages MetaMask for wallet integration and transaction signing, allowing each user to connect directly to the blockchain from their browser. This ensures that only authorized users with valid blockchain accounts can perform actions, enhancing security through cryptographic authentication.

A key feature of the project is its client-side hash verification system, which operates without relying on backend API calls. This not only reduces latency but also mitigates risks associated with server-based data breaches. The hash verification process is powered by a custom or predefined cryptographic function to ensure immutability and tamper detection.

The frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ethers.js, is responsive and user-friendly, offering an intuitive interface for blockchain interactions. Users can connect wallets, initiate transactions, and view results directly from the application interface. Ethers.js acts as the bridge between the UI and the blockchain, enabling smooth integration with the deployed smart contract.

The DAppâ€™s architecture is modular, making it scalable for additional features such as role-based access control, transaction history tracking, or integration with other XDC-based smart contracts. It demonstrates proficiency in blockchain concepts, Solidity smart contract development, decentralized authentication, and frontend engineering.

This project not only serves as a proof-of-concept for secure multi-user blockchain systems but also highlights practical skills in decentralized app design, cryptographic verification, and blockchain network deployment. It reflects strong teamwork, as it was collaboratively developed, tested, and refined to meet both functional and security objectives.
